# **InPhysical Responsive Website Project**

## **Milestone Project 1 for Code Institute Full Stack Software Development.**
### Author - Daniel Cave

The InPysical website is a website created to provide free workout plans for the public. All plans are created by a fully qualified personal trainer and will be updated monthly with new plans. The website offers three different workout plans that can be followed by any experienced fitness fanatic! Users of the website will be able to view all the free and tested plans along with video previews and information on each exercise to allow the user to follow.

The site will have a Home page, about us and what we offer section. Along with a page for each workout plan. Lastly will have a contact page that users can use to contact us with any questions or requests for the website or workout plans.

## **User Experience**
### **Target Audience**
The target audience of the website is to have all fitness users of all experiences. From new beginners to experienced fitness users. The site is to help users to find and use free and tested fitness plans all created by a qualified trainer. For all ages and body types. Finally, users that have created their plans or are looking for inspiration or exercises to help their plans and be able to use the contact forms to ask questions.

### **Website Goals**
The primary goal of the website is to provide free workout plans that are tried and tested by a qualified personal trainer. Another goal of the website is to be a central location for free plans that are all available for users to try and test themselves to find the one most suited for them. Lastly to have a location where users of all experience can ask questions or help with our contact form and receive that help.

## **User Stories**
- ## New User Visitor Goals
    1. The website is designed to allow new users to navigate to available plans with ease.
    2. To provide a central location to view and try each available plan the website offers.
    3. Have information and exercise video tutorials for new users to follow.

- ### Returning Visitor Goals
    1. To have different workout plans that can be tried and tested.
    2. Have a way of contacting someone with questions about the plan or general enquiries.
    3. To have social media links to follow or use to reach out to others.

- ## Design
    - ### Color Scheme
        - In the website design I had choose to use 2 colors. First being #f5f5f5 (Off-White) and 17181A (Dark Grey). When first thinking of how the website should look, the primary goal was a clean and simplistic-looking site. Users can know exactly what the website is about at first glance and easy to navigate. The website also used a gradient colour over the main hero image. The gradient adds a black gradient with 0.75 or 75% transparency on the image. This was used to darken the image to allow text to be viewed. 
    - ### Imagery
        - The website consists of 4 different images that are used in the website. Firstly and the main picture is a man doing a plank exercise in a large open room. This and all the images were found on [Pexals](https://www.pexels.com/) which is a free image library. The other images used were for the workout plan preview links, each where selected for the design of each plan and the majority of muscle groups that would be used. To add a visual representation to the user to entice them into the plan.
    - ### Typography
        - When selecting the font to choose, the same goals were alongside the colour scheme. To find a clean and simplistic font that gives the website the look of professional and friendly. The font that was chosen was "Outfit" a free available font found on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Further Testing 

### Browser Testing
The website responsiveness was tested in the browsers below.
- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Brave

All testing was successful and no browser compatibility issues.
Friends and family were asked to view and use the website as fresh new users. They were able to offer first-time user comments and additions to the website.

## Bugs
- Had an issue with my hero image being displayed when I pushed the website to the GitHub pages. After Google and looking through the documentation, my mentor was able to help with a milestone meeting update. The issue was down to a location request in the CSS.
- When creating the response media queries, there was an issue with the navigation bar overlapping at smaller screen sizes. The issue was to add a media query for that specific issue and then the navigation adjusted correctly with the screen size difference.
- Final issue was when completing the final html validation. During a lighthouse test, it suggested adding an "alt" tag to the footer icons for accessibility. But when completing the html validator it showed as an error due to the i frame cannot have an alt name. Once removed the pages showed with no errors.
