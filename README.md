- ## Design
    - Color Scheme
        - In the website design i had choose to use 2 colors. First being #f5f5f5 (Off-White) and 17181A (Dark Grey). When first thinking of how the website should look, the primary goal was a clean and simplistic looking site. That users can know exactly what the website is about on first glance and easy to navigate. The website also used a gradient color over the main hero image. The gradient adds a black gradient with a 0.75 or 75% transparency on the image. This was used to darken the image to allow text to be viewed. 
    - Imagery
        - The website consists of 4 different images that is used in the website. Firstly and the main picutre is a man doing a inpace plank excercise in a large open room. This and all the images where found on [Pexals](https://www.pexels.com/) which is a free image library. The other images used where for the workout plan preview links, each where selected for the design of each plan and the majority of muscle groups that would be used. To add a visual representation to the user to entice into the plan.
    - Typography
        - When selecting the font to choose, the same goals where alongside the color scheme. To find a clean and simplistic font that gives the website the look of professional and friendly. The font that was chosen was "Outfit" a free avalible font found on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
