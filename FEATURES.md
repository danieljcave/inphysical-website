## Features

### Main Page & Features
The website is made of 6 pages. 
- Index.html (Home Page)
- Contact Us
- Contact Response
- Push Pull Legs
- Full Body
- Upper Lower

Along all pages they each share features used over the entire website. Navigation Bar, Hero Image and Footer. All of the Workout Plan pages share the same site structure and layout of content. Almost all of the contnt is located inside of a width container of 1140px. This is to central all content and have uniformed size over the website. Advice taken from my mentor **Spencer Barriball**.

Each of the Workout plan pages start with a title heading of each plan. The information gives a reason as to select the plan and the benerfits of using the workout plan. The page then displays a guide to structure each day acording to the workout plan. Followed by a brief reason for following the workout plan week structure. There is then a statement regarding all the plans have video links to follow and each plan is a guide and the user is free to edit plan and add or remove workouts.

### Navigation Bar
- The Navigation bar is completly responsive on all pages and devices and has a very simplistic yet clean design.
    - In a desktop view (Screen size of 992px wide and above) the main Logo of "InPhysical" is located on the left side of the screen. All pages and information of "Home", "About Us", "Plans" and "Contact Us". These are located on the right hand side of the screen.
    - In a tablet view (Screen size of 992px to 768px) the main logo is located on the left side of the screen along with rest of the pages is located on the right hand size.
    - In mobile view and smaller devices (Screen sizes under 768px) the logo "InPhysical" is located on the left side. With the small screen sizes the Pages will move closer to the center as page gets smaller. Once the screen size reaches 610px Wide. The text then goes bellow the logo to avoid overlapping.
    - Extra small devices of 350px or bellow. Spacing is removed for the navigation bar to allow for no overlap and uniform style and design from small screen up to desktop design.
